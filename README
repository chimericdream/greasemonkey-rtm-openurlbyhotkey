If you prefer to use the keyboard to navigate your task lists, it can be a pain to switch to the mouse to open links.

This script adds the 'V' key as a hotkey to open links (similar functionality to Google Reader, if you use that). If a selected task has a link, pressing 'V' will open that link in a new window/tab.

@TODO:
-Add customizable hotkey
-Don't popup a window if multiple tasks are selected
